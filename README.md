# animal-farm
An example simulating a farm of animals using design patterns.

Currently a single pattern is used. Look at the code and let me know.

## Ideas for expansion
* Create other animals with different behaviour
* Instead of simulating a whole day in a method, break the method so that it simulates a single step and then returns. Each step could be an hour and the method could be called simulateStep.
* Maybe use the State pattern for the simulatestep (that's something we did not see but it is not so difficult)
* Create the animals via an Abstract Factory
* Having more than one animal in the farm...
* Animals interacting?
* Other creatures in the farm, ...
* Other entities in the farm, ...
